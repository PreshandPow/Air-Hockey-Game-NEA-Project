# Air-Hockey-Game-NEA-Project

A two-player air hockey game built with Python's Pygame library. This project was developed as part of a school's NEA (Non-Examined Assessment) project. It features dynamic gameplay, scoring, and realistic physics, showcasing a solid understanding of game development fundamentals.

Key Features
Two-Player Gameplay: Allows two players to compete against each other using a single keyboard.

Collision Detection: Implements precise collision physics for the puck and paddles, ensuring realistic in-game interactions.

Dynamic Scoring: Tracks and displays scores in real time, with clear win/loss conditions.

Game State Management: Effectively manages different game states, such as the main menu and active gameplay.

What I Learned
This project was a significant exercise in applying core programming concepts to a practical application. Through its development, I gained valuable experience in:

Game Loop Design: Designing and managing a robust game loop that handles player input, updates game objects, and renders the screen.

Physics Simulation: Implementing basic physics, including movement, velocity, and bounce mechanics for game objects.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Using classes to create a modular and scalable design for game objects like the puck and paddles.

User Interface (UI): Creating a clean and functional user interface for displaying scores and game states.

How to Run
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Install Pygame: pip install pygame

Run the main.py file.
